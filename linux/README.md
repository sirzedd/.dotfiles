If your Raspberry Pi does not have xbindkeys installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xbindkeys
```

Once it is installed, you can create a configuration file for it by running:

```bash
xbindkeys --defaults > ~/.xbindkeysrc
```

Then, open the ~/.xbindkeysrc file in a text editor and add the following lines to it:

```yaml
# Open program with escape+space
"program_name"
  Escape + space
```

Replace program_name with the name of the program you want to open.

Save the file and run xbindkeys to start the keybinding daemon. Now, whenever you press the Escape and Space keys together, the specified program should open.

To open an already opened instance of Alacritty with a key binding in xbindkeys, you can use the wmctrl command. wmctrl is a command-line tool that can be used to interact with the X Window System's window manager.

Here is an example of how to open an already opened instance of Alacritty with a key binding in xbindkeys:

Install wmctrl using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install wmctrl
```

Create or edit the ~/.xbindkeysrc file and add the following line:

```yaml
"wmctrl -a Alacritty || alacritty"
    Escape + space
```

This will try to activate an existing instance of Alacritty and if it doesn't exist, it will launch a new one.

Save and close the ~/.xbindkeysrc file.

Reload the xbindkeys configuration by running the following command:

```bash
xbindkeys -p
```

Now, when you press Escape + space, it will activate the already opened instance of Alacritty, or launch a new one if it doesn't exist.

is there a way to hide alacritty using the same keys when alacritty is focused
Yes, you can use a tool like xdotool to send a "window minimize" command to the Alacritty window when it is in focus.

First, make sure xdotool is installed on your system by running sudo apt-get install xdotool in a terminal.

Then, create a new line in your ~/.xbindkeysrc file for the key combination you want to use to minimize the Alacritty window. For example:

```yaml
"xdotool windowminimize $(xdotool getactivewindow)"
  Escape+space
```

This will send the "window minimize" command to the active window (i.e. the Alacritty window that is currently in focus) when you press Escape + Space.


Assuming you have saved the script as toggle_alacritty.sh, you can use the following command in your .xbindkeysrc file to bind it to the Escape+Space key combination:

```yaml
"toggle_alacritty.sh"
  Escape + space
```

Make sure that the script is executable by running chmod +x toggle_alacritty.sh.
