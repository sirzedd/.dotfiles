# DotFiles

This is a repo of the dotfiles I use between my local computer and work computer. Most of these are templates that were grabbed from different places or things I have found on stackoverflow.

I've tried to orginize what comes from where.

Ran into this one [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/tree/master/zsh)
