# DotFiles

This rep contains my personal dotfiles that I have been using between my computers.  


The goal has been to keep my personal configs separate from work by referencing my personal files from the work ones.  This allows me to add work specific in the machine and I won't worry about uploading anything.


## bin/.local/bin

Contain my scripts for getting things done

## terminal

I tried to split up all the sources I use in terminal to keep them organized.  I might need to revisit this organization later.

## vim

Contains some of personal nvim configs


## .dotfiles to follow for insperation ðŸ¤©
