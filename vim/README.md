# Vim

## Description

I'm trying to get better with VIM to help increase my speed of getting work done by no needing a mouse.  Not sure I'm used to it enough and I was better at it at demandware.  But this is my Vim for YSG.

The plugins are from my time at demandware.  I wanted to remember what I had on vim when I was there.  The .vimrc is my usage from YSG.  It's pretty basic.
