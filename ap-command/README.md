# AP Commands


## Description

These are commands that I created when I was at HomeAdvisor to be able to quickly develop.  They are built in Groovy and were helpful.  Some of the commands would still be helpful but would be better built using Golang or Rust.

Note: Currently this doesn't work locally, groovy or java version issue perhaps


## Commands

* help - show usage
* notes - current notes (before obsidian)
* bookmark - bookmark files and folders
* list - list of project namespace
* todo - file holding todos
* view - view project details
* new-project - create new projects
* edit-project - edit project 
* add-path - add to project path (I believe this is project as in workspace)
* remove-path
* delete-path
* open - open project
* temp - re-open temp file used for pipe commands
* script - open scripts folder
* file - open file 
* new - open new window 
* current - add project to current window
* watch - ability to watch for changes in folder to files and run command.  Good for re-running spring-boot run without intellij.  I believe Gradle has a way to do this.
