# How to get this to work

    brew cask install hammerspoon
    brew cask install karabiner-elements

Setup hammerspoon hyper key [link](https://kalis.me/setup-hyper-key-hammerspoon-macos/)

Use karabiner-elements to map key **caps_lock** to **f18**

The **init.lua** is the initial main file which calls into **hyper.lua** and **spectacle.lua**.
