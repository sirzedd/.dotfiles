# SKHD

This is being used in place of karabiner elements to manage shortcuts.  

I have mapped, using a terminal command, caps lock to F18.  

Hammerspoon maps certain keys from F18 to cmd + shift + control + alt + <letter>

SKHD has a built in hyper for that combination letting us write shortcuts.


If for some reason a letter doesn't work hammerspoon might not have mapped it or is using it.


Running `skhd` can be done either with the command or for longer running `brew services start skhd`
